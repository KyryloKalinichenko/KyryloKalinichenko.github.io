            <p>I'm very excited to be here with you. I'm 25yo expat who moved to Belgium 5 years ago. 
                It is not the first CS course for me. But I'm sure that I will learn a lot here with you! So I wish you all the best of luck! </p>

                One of my hobbies is gaming, so if you play Apex let me know <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199065327084/">here</a>.

                PS: I spend all my time for this task on this animation. So I have just one page. This animation I found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHrV2ZHzF-0">tutorial</a>.
